//! Failover and load-aware rehoming.
//!
//! When a community's home node goes down, its ownership **lease lapses** and the
//! community becomes unowned (`owner_of` → `None`). A peer then takes over — but
//! only a node that already holds a caught-up replica may, or votes would be lost.
//! The designated **standbys** are exactly those pre-warmed nodes, so failover
//! promotes a standby. The [`claim`](crate::OwnershipRegistry::claim) that does so
//! bumps the epoch, fencing the old owner if it returns.
//!
//! Among eligible standbys the **lowest-traffic** one is chosen, so a community
//! rehomes onto a quiet node rather than piling onto a busy one — the
//! load-balancing the deployment asked for. The winner then designates a fresh
//! standby (again the quietest live node) so the community is once more protected.
//!
//! The placement decisions are pure functions
//! ([`choose_new_owner`](choose_new_owner::choose_new_owner),
//! [`choose_new_standby`](choose_new_standby::choose_new_standby)) so they are
//! exhaustively testable;
//! [`RehomingController`](rehoming_controller::RehomingController) ties them to the
//! control plane.
